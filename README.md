# Problem Statement

The square–rectangle problem in software development illustrates several pitfalls which can arise
when using subtype polymorphism in object modelling. The issues are most commonly encountered
when using object-oriented programming (OOP). By definition, this problem is a violation of the
Liskov substitution principle, one of the SOLID principles.
